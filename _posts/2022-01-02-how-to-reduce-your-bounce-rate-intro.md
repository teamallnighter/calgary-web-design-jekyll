# How To Reduce Your Bounce Rate

## Introduction to bounce rates

This month we will be going over how to reduce your bounce rate. This being the first article lets just get introduced to what a bounce rate is. 

## What is Bounce Rate?

Bounce rate is an Internet marketing term used in web traffic analysis. It represents the percentage of visitors who enter the site and then leave rather than continuing to view other pages within the same site.

## Why Should I Reduce My Bounce Rate?

Bounce rates are important because they might indicate that the page content is irrelevant, or confusing to your site visitors. A high bounce rate on your home page for example, would be alarming, because that means people are only viewing that page alone, then clicking away.

From Google:

> Is a high bounce rate a bad thing?
> It depends. If the success of your site depends on users viewing more than one page, then, yes, a high bounce rate is bad. For example, if your home page is the gateway to the rest of your site (e.g., news articles, product pages, your checkout process) and a high percentage of users are viewing only your home page, then you donâ€™t want a high bounce rate. On the other hand, if you have a single-page site like a blog, or offer other types of content for which single-page sessions are expected, then a high bounce rate is perfectly normal.

## What is a Good (or bad) Bounce Rate?

So, what is a good bounce rate? A bounce rate of 56% to 70% is on the high side, although there could be a good reason for this, and 41% to 55% would be considered an average bounce rate. An optimal bounce rate would be in the 26% to 40% range.

## Why Do Users Bounce?

1. Slow Loading
2. Misleading Descriptions
3. Low-Quality Content
4. Error 404
5. Bad Link from Another Site
6. Your site is not Mobile Friendly
7. Bad Form
8. No CTA (call to action)
9. Poor User Experience
