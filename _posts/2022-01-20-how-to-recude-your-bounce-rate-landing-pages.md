# Build Landing Pages

One challenge companies stumble upon when working to reduce bounce rates, is predicting the entry points to your site. It doesn’t matter how perfect your home page is if most traffic comes from a blog article that wasn’t optimized for engagement.

Landing pages are a great solution for that. They are specifically designed to serve as the optimal entry point — with compelling layouts and CTAs. 

Think about the opportunities you have to create more of them and how you can adapt your marketing strategy to lead your traffic.

## How To Build A Landing Page

1. In terms of content, the landing page has one simple message to convey. It promotes the desired action and sticks to explaining the benefits of performing this action.  

2. The design of the page needs to focus on supporting this objective and nothing else. This also means that the website design should be clean and simple, so as to ensure a smooth browsing experience and not to compete for the viewers’ attention.  

3. The ultimate goal of a landing page is to make site visitors click. Both the design and the text of the page need to reflect that, so make sure that all buttons are labeled with clear microcopy and that they stand out against the page’s background.  

4. A landing page, as its name may suggest, is made up of one single page. You can divide it into separate sections, but you should stick to just one page that preferably isn’t too long.  

5. Headers, subheaders, buttons and images need to represent the page’s message in a powerful and effective way, while ensuring that all elements remain cohesive. Check out this selection of best landing page examples for inspiration.

6. Unless you’re planning on designing your landing page from scratch, make sure you’re using a professional landing page template. This will help ensure that your LP doesn’t only look good, but also has a strong visual hierarchy that instantly leads your visitors exactly where you want them most.
