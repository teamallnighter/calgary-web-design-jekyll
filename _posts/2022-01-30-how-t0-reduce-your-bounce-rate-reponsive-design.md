# Ensure Your Site Is Responsive

![How to reduce your bounce rate by keeping content above the fold](https://calgaryweb.design/assets/img/blog/above-the-fold-web-design.jpg)

If you follow your analytics for your site you’ve probably come accross the term “Bounce Rate”

## What is bounce rate?

Bounce rate is an Internet marketing term used in web traffic analysis. It represents the percentage of visitors who enter the site and then leave rather than continuing to view other pages within the same site. If you are starting fresh on reducing your bounce rate, you should read [THIS ARTICLE](https://calgaryweb.design/blog/how-to-reduce-your-bounce-rate-intro/) before moving on.


## What is “The Fold”

Above the fold is the upper half of the front page of a newspaper or tabloid where an important news story or photograph is often located. Papers are often displayed to customers folded so that only the top half of the front page is visible.

## Tips for keeping your content above the fold

### Add a powerful H1 tag

Your H1 tag (also known as your heading tag) is the first thing people will see. The goal of your headline is to hook your visitor’s attention. It’ll also form the foundation for the rest of the page.

Your header can also communicate your unique selling proposition (USP). This is what sets your site apart from the competition, and helps to spell out what makes your website unique.

It’ll help to answer the question in your visitor’s mind: am I in the right place?

When creating your page header put yourself in your visitor’s shoes. They’ve just landed on your website and they’re trying to figure out what makes your website different from the millions of other sites out there.

The same goes for every page on your site, whether that’s your homepage, services, page, or even the headlines on your blog posts.

If you’re creating the header for your homepage you’ll want this to describe your company in as few words as possible, while still making it stand out. Your header will communicate this unique value, while the copy further down the page will further expand upon this headline, or promise you made to your visitors.

### Add keywords in the opening paragraphs

When it comes to optimizing for the search engines and improving your chances of actually ranking, where you include keywords in your content is important.

Your content needs to be compelling and grab the visitor’s attention, but you also need to be aware of proper keyword placement.

If possible, include your SEO keywords as early on within the content as possible. Ideally, within your opening paragraphs.

This lets the search engines know what your page is going to be about, plus it helps to let your readers know they’re in the right place.

### Optimize for Google featured snippet

Featured snippets typically appear at the top of Google’s search results and seek to answer the search term in the search results themselves.

Usually, this information is pulled from the top-ranking pages, but it can also be pulled from pages that aren’t ranking as high. Which means you can get more traffic and rankings without as much SEO effort.

Beyond traffic, it can also be a great way to establish your brand. When you have the featured snippet it lends more credibility to your website. Plus, on mobile devices, the featured snippet is guaranteed the first thing your visitors will see.

There are a variety of different kinds of featured snippets including:

Paragraph Numbered list Bullet list Table Video The majority of the content that “wins” the featured snippet ranks in the top 10 search results.

But, how do you optimize for the featured snippet?

![Optimize google snippet](https://calgaryweb.design/assets/img/blog/featured-snippet.png)

Start by answering the question – Instead of starting your post with a long intro, try to answer the user’s question, or the main information from the keyword as early in the text as possible. Then, you can proceed with everything else that backs up that answer.

Format your content properly – If there’s already a piece of content ranking for the featured snippet, then make sure you format your post the same way.

Overall, you’ll want to make your content digestible and easy to skim, which means:

Use bullet points, and numbered lists Include a table to organize information Use descriptive headers Add a relevant image

### Add visible call to action buttons

A call to action (CTA) is often oriented with your visitors making a purchase, or interacting with the page in some way.

Ultimately, the call-to-action you choose to place above the fold will depend on the type of website you’re running.

Keep in mind that the call to action doesn’t have to be tied to making a purchase either. It could even be joining your email list, or simply learning more about what you offer.

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself the question: what action do you want your visitors to take?

Here are a few tips to keep in mind when crafting your CTA:

It needs to capture your visitor’s attention It needs to be engaging (not something boring like “Click Here”) It needs to make sense in the context of the rest of the content It needs to be short, don’t make your CTA a sentence It needs to invoke urgency so your visitors take action now, not a week from now

Make sure that there is text content above the fold

When it comes to ranking in the search engines, the length of your content matters. In fact, according to research, the average word count of pages ranking on the first page of Google is over 2000 words.

This more so applies to blog post length. However, the same can be said for most other pages of your website.

For example, if you’re an IT company that’s serving multiple different regions, you’ll want each of these pages to have enough content. This gives you enough space to provide value to your visitors, while targeting your main and related keywords, without stuffing your content.

This also applies to your homepage, or other landing pages where you’re asking people to sign-up, or take action based on your CTA.

For example, if you just have a headline, an image, and a CTA this often won’t be enough for people to take action. Especially, if this is the first time visiting your site.

You’ll need additional content to educate your visitors and provide them with useful information.

If you’re struggling to come up with ways to add more content to your site, try these ideas:

Add a FAQ section to your homepage or landing pages Create service page sections that break down your offerings Create a team bio section that highlights roles and responsibilities Add sales page elements to your pages including stories, benefits, and mo

### Add Alt text for images

Image optimization is commonly overlooked. However, by taking the little added time to optimize your images for related keywords you can pull in some additional traffic. Just as people are searching for written content, they’re doing the same thing for images and other visual content.

There are a few different ways to optimize your images, but the most important is what’s known as “Alt text” or “Alt tag”. If you’re using WordPress you’ll find a small text field that lets you input relevant keywords. These will show up when a user hovers over the image, in some cases.

You can also optimize your images by creating descriptive image filenames, and by decreasing the total size of your images, so they load faster.

Overall, the goal with image optimization is to provide the search engines with even more context about what your page/website is about while providing a better user experience to your visitors.

Disable lazy loading for above the fold images
Lazy Loading Image

When a visitor lands on your website, all of the content is usually loaded at once before the page is displayed to the visitor. Instead of loading everything at once, you can use lazy loading.

Lazy loading is a process that only loads content when a user visits that part of the page. So, if a user only views the top part of your web page and immediately leaves, the bottom of the page will never load. This can greatly improve site loading speeds.

Having a fast loading website is essential for your website to succeed, both for SEO reasons and for user experience. But, your above the fold content must load before the rest of your page.

With lazy loading on images, you can sometimes run into issues, where text content will load well before any images.

You don’t want half of your above the fold content to load, while your bottom of the fold content has already loaded.

If your above the fold content takes too long your visitors will start scrolling down the page, which can lead to confusing messaging.

For example, if you have a large header image on your homepage or a featured image at the top of your blog post, you’ll want these to load before anything else below it loads.

If you’re using lazy loading across your site, make sure you disable it for images that are located above the fold. You can still use it for other areas of your website. Especially for image-heavy blog posts, or listicles.
